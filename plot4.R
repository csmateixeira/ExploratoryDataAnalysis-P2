## Question 4
# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

NEI <- readRDS("data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Summarizing the data:
# - We only care about coal combustion related sourcesso filtering SCC based on EI.Sector that contains "Coal"
# - Merged NEI with SCC - only relevant "Coal" related rows are merged
# - Group NEI by year since we want the data summarized according to year
Summary <- 
    NEI %>% 
        merge(SCC[grepl("Coal", SCC$EI.Sector, perl = TRUE), c("SCC", "EI.Sector")], by = "SCC") %>%
            group_by(year)

ylab <- expression(PM[2.5] * " (Log10 Scale)")
main <- expression(PM[2.5] * " Emissions In The US From Coal combustion-Related Sources")

## Using boxplots to show the overall change year-on-year: this way all changes are considered - changes in median, percentiles, outliers, etc.
## Using the Log10 scale since it still reflects the same proportions in the change while making the graph (more) readable
print(
    ggplot(
        Summary, 
        aes(x = factor(year), y = log10(Emissions))

    + labs (
